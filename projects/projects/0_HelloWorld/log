9/04  3:15pm  1:45  read assignment, configured zoo shortcuts, ported over zoo files to local system

9/14  5:15pm  0:15  wrote and tested code

I discussed my solution with: N/A


It was very satisfying using FUSE to mount my zoo project folder onto my local desktop so I could edit directly with Sublime text. After some configuration, I was also able to use z as a shortcut to go into the Zoo. Overall, I think I'm happy with this setup! (I would like to learn how to use GitHub side-by-side however.)
