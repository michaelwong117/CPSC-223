I discussed my solution with: Neil Sachdeva, Kyle Wang
(and watched six episodes of Jujutsu Kaisen and some Squid Game).

DISCUSSION

Debugging gmap.c was extremely difficult because I had to learn how to 
track and trace valgrind errors. I had to manually keep in mind all the places
where I wasn't freeing (or in many cases, double freeing), which is especially
difficult given the size of the program and the many cases and functions I was handling.
Another problem was figuring out the pointer logic: oftentimes it was confusing and hard
to wrap my head around. For gmap, it really helped to write out a detailed picture
of the nodes on pen and paper and then translate that image into code. For blotto,
as well, debugging the actual code proved difficult. I think once I had a working implementation
of blotto it really helped me speed along since I could use the example cases to check my code. 
I think overall, I learned a lot about valgrind and debugging and also had a mini mental-breakdown.
Finally, implementing the edge cases and working out the casework was very tricky. I really had
to write out the different cases and unit test my code as I went to make sure my ideas were good.
