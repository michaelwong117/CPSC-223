/**
 * Reads pairs of integers from the input file with the given name,
 * applies the given function to them, and writes the result to the
 * output file with the given name.
 * 
 * The output file will contain one integer per line with
 * no whitespace other then the newline at the end of each line.
 * 
 * The input will contain one pair of integers per line, with any
 * number of whitespace characters except for newlines separating the
 * two integers and preceeding or following the integers.
 * 
 * You may assume that the input and output filenames refer to
 * different files.  If the output file already exists then it is
 * truncated so its previous contents are replaced with the new
 * output.  If there is an error opening either the input file or the
 * output file then there is no output.  If the input is not as
 * specified then the behavior is undefined, but the function must not
 * crash or hang.

 * Once you're ready to test your code, run ./testit on the command line
